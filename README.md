# React Burger Builder

This project is from the [React Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) I am following as part of my month of learning React project I started on December 1st.  Information about that project can be found at [at this repo](https://github.com/xmtrinidad/UdemyReact)

## About

Section 8 of the Udemy React course creates a burger builder that uses concepts from sections 1-7, which includes:
* Functional Components
* Class Components with state
* Utilizing various ES6 concepts to create dynamic components
* Project structure and best practices

I've done a few of my own projects using the concepts from these sections whle also following along with the tutorial for the Burger Builder.  Checkout my [github repos](https://github.com/xmtrinidad) to view them.

I will update this readme with notable things I've learned from following along through the development of this application.
